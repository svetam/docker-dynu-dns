## docker-dynu-dns

This Alpine/Debian Linux based Docker image uses dynu.com service IP protocol to update dynamic DNS records.

### Setup

```sh
docker run --name=dynu-dns --restart=always \
-e HOST=... \
-e USER=... \
-e PASSWORD=... \
svetam/docker-dynu-dns
```

This will create container and set its `restart` policy to `always`. This means that container will be automatically started on startup and in a case of error. To stop service use `docker stop <name>`.

To run container on `armv7` architectures use `svetam/docker-dynu-dns:arm32v7` image. This is tested and working on WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra. 

`:latest` is tested on `Mac OS`
`:arm32v7` is tested on `WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra`
